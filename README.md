This is a full-stack application that helps to organize and manage video calls. The users can create an event, in which they choose the theme- classroom, medical call, webinar; after they choose the date and the settings they want for that especific call. 


## User Stories

-  **404:** As a user I get to see a 404 page with a feedback message if I try to reach a page that does not exist so that I know it's my fault.
-  **Signup:** As an anonymous user I can sign up on the platform so that I can start creating and managing my events/calls.
-  **Login:** As a user I can login to the platform so that I can access my profile and start creating and managing events/calls.
-  **Logout:** As a logged in user I can logout from the platform so no one else can use it.
-  **Profile Page**: As a logged in user I can visit my profile page so that I can access the edit page and see the list of events I have created.
-  **Create Event:** As a logged in user I can access the events page so that I can choose and create a new event.
-  **Edit Event:** As a logged in user I can access the edit event page so that I can edit the event/room I created.
